      - Logic
        - route -> api -> useAuthReducer -> authProvider
        - useAuthAction -> authProvider -> useAuth -> auth-form

    - Types

      - [x] Auth
        - [x] Global authState
        - [x] useAuthAction
        - [x] useAuthReducer
      - [x] Otp
        - [x] useVerifyOtp
      - [x] Typesafety

    - Better error handling
      - [x] Otp
      - [x] Sign-up
      - [x] Login

    - [ ] Google auth
    - [ ] Facebook auth

  - Misc
    - [x] Make use of useReducer
      - Just like useActionState but use when managing multiple switch cases
    - [ ] Single responsibility concept SRC
    - [ ] useQuery()

  - Node.js website inspiration
    - [ ] Structure
      - [x] Multi-Purpose React Hooks are defined on `apps/site/hooks`
        - If the Hook as a wider usability or can be used by other components, it should be placed in the root `hooks` folder.
      - [ ] Utility functions
        - Small utility functions that is then used by hooks
      - [x] Multi-Purpose TypeScript definitions are defined on `apps/site/types`
      - [x] React Context Providers are defined on `apps/site/providers`
      - [ ] Build-time Data Fetching Scripts are defined on `apps/site/next-data`
        - Used for Node.js Release data fetching
        - Generation of build-time indexes such as blog data
        - Provider of generated data
        ```text
        CRUD
        - Creating, updating & deleting data on api
        - Data fetching on next-data
          - Generation for fetching
          - Seperate provider for passing generated/fethed data
        ```
      - [ ] Storybook Configuration is done within `apps/site/.storybook`
        - We use an almost out-of-the-box Storybook Experience with a few extra customisations

    - [ ] Components
      - [ ] Creating components
        - Structure template
          ```text
          - ComponentName
            - __tests__/ // component tests (such as unit tests, etc)
              - index.test.mjs // unit tests should be done in ESM and not TypeScript
            - index.tsx // the component itself
            - index.module.css // all styles of the component are placed there
            - index.stories.tsx // component Storybook stories
            - SubComponentName
              - same philosophy
          ```
        - always export components as default
        - Avoid making a component too big. Deconstruct it into smaller Components/Hooks whenever possible.
      - [ ] Styling
        - PostCSS + Tailwind
        - CSS classes should be camelCase
        - Use Tailwind's `@apply` selector to apply Tailwind Tokens
        - Create mixins for reusable animations, effects and more `@styles/mixins`
